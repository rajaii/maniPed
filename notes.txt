CURRENT =>=>=>: 

 =========>

            make rating component, and actions and reducer, and request logic ,

                -make 2 requests/actions: 1st to user_ratings where user_rating_id and provider_rating_id to see if rating exists if it does, 
                render a already rated component, and if not render the rating component

                

            
             and ability to cancel/delete a booking, or delete addressses or anything else in the feedsub or app think deletes

            Add in past_services on subfeed: rate this provider 
            (opens up a rating component whose request is linked to the ids to put the rating for them) or book this provider ( Opens up a booking screen for the provider, popuate with the ids here) again

             set up cancellation action, reducer, and mechanism on dashboard somewhere for future bookings and wishlist
            
            add in wishlist a messge provider button that takes to the messaging to them 

            maybe add a rebook button on completed services so can book again??
            

            implement photos with cloud for profiels, and move on to V

            implement socket.io or twilio for mesaging and reminders

            implement google maps api for geolocation when 1 hr to apt

                [
        
            make it so they can message their provider in feed too.

            if click on profile conditionally render profile component under the feedsub and allow to edit, if click on past services 
            render a past services component which will conditionally render another component for that, and for wishlist the same in this component 
            they can message the upcoming provider to notify them or remind them to confirm.
            
                ]

            3)programmatically send reminders 24 hours and 1 hour before the meerting to both. TWILIO for this and for messaging  Fire up gps on provider and user within hour, have provider
            tap button to indicate on the way and then show on user app how far they are.

            AFTER ^ intiate logic to complete service, rate, confirmations, messages, emails, etc socketio messageing too

        
            profile tab with ability to edit profile info,add picture adding ability via cloud at this point

            add the button on ligin for forgot pw and functionality 

            add verify email address upon register

            for every email addition/put need to send confirmation emails upon request to verify

            later later must go through and send user proper errors from reducer if for example username is taken or email is taken on 
            puts and posts




================================================================================================================================================

TODO:


PROGRAMMATICS (tweaks to those features that are added already):


    API:

        make it so frontend provider app and email message go to provider to confirm after booking post made.

        make it so duplicate bookings can not happen.

        Cloud storage for photos and then link storage in db for pulling to FE for image display tweak routes/helpers and migrations accordingly 
        when get there see API to FE INTEGRATION: Images

        notifications 24 hours before and 1 hour before appointments to provider and user

        google maps api for directions and showing where provider is on arrival time of appointments

        socket.io messageing for users and providers  with bot messages regarding upcoming appointments

        email/text notifications sent to all higher ups when anyone added to admin or manigods db

        Documentation

    FRONT-END APPS:

        Before finishing User REACT FE:
             !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [   store tokens in cookie (security) or switch to oauth possibly ie figur out protected route bug somehow

            dashboard not working on privateRoute giving this error V  

            Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

            figure out how to push (use from login to dash when logged in, use on booking to go to dash when success message discarded) ]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        Validations needed from FE via yup:
        Signup:(see migrations)
        //will have to use something to validate these fields ie yup from frontend to make sure pw is certain legnth and has symbols lower upper and 1 num and zipcode


        Role MGMT:
        //Manigods UI app will be local only on manigods machines and accessed via the private repo that only I an d joseph have access too.  not deployed, 
        //NOTE FOR FE: when making admin interface do not enter password field for updating profiles, api does not allow that too

        PROVIDER FE:
        DASH STUFF FOR PROVIDER NOT DONE ON THESE STEPS (was started when making email requests upon booking logic):
       send out success message to user on dash, send out verification email to provider, and verification notice on provider dash FE
            PSEUDO:
            in bookingsRouter after the post, send an email to both provider to verify, and then to the user to congratulate

            in the put router if they are verifying: send an email notice to the user and provider stating that it has been verified and 
            also to the provider, and dash notices to both 

===============================================================================================================================================


PLANNING (possible future features not added in yet):

    possbily tie available_services to providers and make route do more, just get for fe and post for admin for now done before this.

    services: mani pedi, waxing, hair, 

    Figure out if manigods use same interface as admin as well, or have a public manigods w special permissions that can not add to admin db and 
    do other super private tranactions on that ie option A: 2 interfaces 1 public; 1 private, or option B: just 1 private and then separate
     admin accounts (will for forseeable future not need the first option so can get done faster with option B)

    PAYMENT:
    //find a framework to handle this, but may need to delete that later

API to FE INTEGRATION:

    reg/login: 
        if errors from BE display those to user ie username taken.

        push user on fe to login on successful login, if decide to do on fe look at comments on register.js but props.history.push is a PIA with    
        react-router-v4 try to do from BE

    images: 
    For upload and api:
        https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file
    use Cloudinary
    ABANDONED THIS CLOUD STORAGE IS MORE EFFECTIVE.  LEAVE ALL ROUTERS/HELPERS UNUSED AND MIGRATIONS COMMENTED OUT UNTIL LATER MAY TWEAK TO USE WITH CLOUD
    OR DELETE WHAT ISN'T NEEDED LATER. 


    RATINGS:
    may need to tweak the nullability of the ratings and rating ids later when we see the flow of how services are entered from front end when done 
    see line 70-72 user_ratingsRouter.js: the ids will come from where and the flow of the rating process to the user to rate the provider

    no lifetime rating database column/table, will compute the rating on a get call to the users/providers ratings and take the avg and post that to the fe,

    after you post the rating user_rating_id for the service needs to be updated in services by taking the id from user_ratings. (service id will be taken from a get by fe that will pull info on the service to 
    be rated for the rating screen and thus pre populated on the follow up put that will go through with the post see line 82 of userratingsRouter.js)

    ADMIN:
    may need to pull timestamps (created_at etc) in get calls and format that so admin can see when the profiles created etc.
 
    BOOKINGS AND SERVICES
    when making bookings (post see bookingsRouter line 56-57) userId will come from the users data, and provider_id will come from a screen where you click on the provider to book
    confirmations sent to provider upon user booking, when they click to confirm, the put will be called to change the tbl.boolean comfrimed to 1


    post will be used when the provider completes the service.  They will verify to end and then it will post to completed services, and then rating 
    notifications will go out to both user and provider (immediately to provider like uber does) see line 70-72 of servicesRouter.js



VERY END before deploy production:

    
    
    UNCOMMENT THE CHECKROLES MIDDLEWARE CALLS ON THE ROUTES

    prettify code

    DRY:
    in migrations maybe make a function for some of the redundant schemas if they stay the same ie admin and manigods before final implementation.  leave as is now for debugging,
    refactoring, and comments


===============================================================================================================================================

DEBUGGINGS:

     knex seed:run:
    _SEED Error: Error while executing "C:\Users\rosin\a_jProjects\maniPed\seeds\bookings.js" seed: truncate "future_bookings" restart identity - cannot truncate a table referenced in a 
    foreign key constraint
     may have to add created at in seeds if doesnt run, also knexfile configs were changed, adding seed dir and pool config

     line 33 and 34 of nav.js in FE desktop set better (more specific) logic to see if user logged in.  prob using authreducer.isLoggedIn will work when 
     app is running and not cutting in and off, so try that again when deployed and test to see.   









===========================================================================================================================
User React app plan:
Home will have a landing page with login taking customers to their dashboard

components: nav, about, services, login, signup, 

dashboard (when logged in) will have more things ie search for services, providers in area, messaging, etc
