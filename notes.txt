     ==>   add stripe for payments:

                trouble integrating.  saving card then not charging on completed services, see FE line 42 carSetupFormjs (this was not done and prob
                has to do with the integration failure) and be line 101 in servicesRouter.js -this is where it breaks.
                
                
                will also need to add the means to collect payments and then wire it into the post for completed services.
                => working on last part of this line 122 services router and last portion of above page on docs.  Need to add that whole flow docs
                mention.
                also will need to add all the other stuff in the flow that is commented in the react code.

                send name in reciept, wire CardSetupForm.js to redux and pull from state follow stripes instructions on cardsetup form too.
                fix bug see feedsub.js line 296

                make it won't let them book without entering payment information. 

            

            add the button on ligin for forgot pw and functionality 

            add verify email address upon register

            for every email addition/put need to send confirmation emails upon request to verify if email not sent do not update if not verified in 
            24 hours set back to email from before

            display users rating on profile.

            set up so if logged in home button goes to dashboard and login and signup are hidden

            set up protected routes or cookie login.  figure way around the bug from before.

TODO:


PROGRAMMATICS (tweaks to those features that are added already):


    API:

        notifications 24 hours before and 1 hour before appointments to provider and user

        google maps api for directions and showing where provider is on arrival time of appointments

        socket.io messageing for users and providers  with bot messages regarding upcoming appointments

        email/text notifications sent to all higher ups when anyone added to admin or manigods db

        Documentation



|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||


    FRONT-END APPS:

        Before finishing User REACT FE:
             !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [   store tokens in cookie (security) or switch to oauth possibly ie figur out protected route bug somehow

            dashboard not working on privateRoute giving this error V  


        Role MGMT:
        //Manigods UI app will be local only on manigods machines and accessed via the private repo that only I an d joseph have access too.  not deployed, 
        //NOTE FOR FE: when making admin interface do not enter password field for updating profiles, api does not allow that too

        PROVIDER FE:
        DASH STUFF FOR PROVIDER NOT DONE ON THESE STEPS (was started when making email requests upon booking logic):
       send out success message to user on dash, send out verification email to provider, and verification notice on provider dash FE
            PSEUDO:
            in bookingsRouter after the post, send an email to both provider to verify, and then to the user to congratulate

            in the put router if they are verifying: send an email notice to the user and provider stating that it has been verified and 
            also to the provider, and dash notices to both 

===============================================================================================================================================


PLANNING (possible future features not added in yet):

    possbily tie available_services to providers and make route do more, just get for fe and post for admin for now done before this.

    services: nails, massage, hair, waxing 


API to FE INTEGRATION:

    reg/login: 
        if errors from BE display those to user ie username taken.

        push user on fe to login on successful login, if decide to do on fe look at comments on register.js but props.history.push is a PIA with    
        react-router-v4 try to do from BE

    


    RATINGS:
    may need to tweak the nullability of the ratings and rating ids later when we see the flow of how services are entered from front end when done 
    see line 70-72 user_ratingsRouter.js: the ids will come from where and the flow of the rating process to the user to rate the provider

    no lifetime rating database column/table, will compute the rating on a get call to the users/providers ratings and take the avg and post that to the fe,


    ADMIN:
    may need to pull timestamps (created_at etc) in get calls and format that so admin can see when the profiles created etc.



VERY END before deploy production:

    make desktops responsive,
    rego through and change how tag userids if changed to cookies.

    set stripe test keys to live secret key

    enter notification url in upload presets of cloudinary act settings > upload > maniped_preset
    
    UNCOMMENT THE CHECKROLES MIDDLEWARE CALLS ON THE ROUTES

    prettify code



===============================================================================================================================================

    does not have info before pushing to dashboard after login, fix prob w async await

            add in wishlist a messge provider button that takes to the messaging to them

             [
