Sharing economy meets the cosmetics industry.

This is the server run with Node.js/Express using knex.js for the db connected to PostgreSQL.  

Project was done in the months after my coding bootcamp before next employment opportunity was started.  I discontinued it because of 2 things:

  1: Business reasons.
  
  2: I learned all the things I did wrong at my next job which was solely building React, and React-Native apps from scratch in a constant     time crunch for very picky clients.  
  
 Api is here and the customer client React app is also pinned on my homepage, and the provider client React app is barely started, but also pinned to the homepage.  Styling is horrendous on those so beware; I'm not a designer, and spun those up just for show after I had decided to quit the project.
